# Belgium Country Dropdown

This project tests the new functionality of adding **Belgium** to the country dropdown.  
- Belgium should appear after USA in the list.  
- Selecting Belgium should open a new tab with **currency = pounds**.  
- Apply button should be visible and enabled.  
- Bug found: Belgium flag is missing in dropdown and currency tab.
